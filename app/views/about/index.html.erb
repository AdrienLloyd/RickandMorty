<p>I will be grabbing my main data from a Rick and Morty API and I
will be adding bogus data from the Faker gem. There is a dataset of
all the characters, the episodes, and locations, but I will only be
using the characters and episodes. I will associate the characters
with what episodes they were in and I will also associate the
characterswith a favourite food with Faker::Science and Faker::Food.</p>
